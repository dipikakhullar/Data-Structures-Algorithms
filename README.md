# Data-Structures-Algorithms

My implementations of data structures, important algorithms, and interesting coding interview problems. For studying purposes to master the coding interview. 

Goals:
** write up detailed solutions to hard leetcode problems
** Go through thought process and intuition to apply to other problems
** Organize files by problem statement/concepts?
