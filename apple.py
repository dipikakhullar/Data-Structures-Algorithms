Time Complexity:
We are doing DFS from each node. DFS runtime is O(V+E), in this case V=16, so DFS runtime is O(1).

However, because we are traversing all the sequences, this complicates things a bit and our runtime is no longer constant. 

For each node, we call DFS and they traverse the other 15 nodes, but all 8 branches traverse the other 14 nodes, and all 8 branches traverse the other 13 nodes, and so on. 
This looks a lot like factorial runtime. O(N!)

Optimizations:
1. Using a trie for pruning => check whether our string + candidate adjacent letter 
is a substring of some word (otherwise we do not need explore from that letter)

2. A DP (dynamic programming)version algorithm ( Bellman-Held-Karp algorithm) will have the complexity of O(2^n * nÂ²). 
By reducing the complexity from factorial to exponential, if the size of n is relatively small the problem can be solvable.

Please note: This algorithm runs ~423 seconds.
